  # So whenever we have identical code, it's best to put it in a method and use it in a before_action method such as above.

  # GET /blogs
  # GET /blogs.json
  #Whenever we go to localhost:3000/blogs, this index action is what is referenced.

  # GET /blogs/1.json
  # This is going to show the particular blog post that we'd click on.
  def show
    # The reason why this method is empty is because it goes to LINE 2, which gets the set_blog method down below.
    # The code in the set_blog method will be [virtually] present in the show method due to the before_action method
    # in line 2.

  # This creates a new instance of the blog, not an entirely new blog.
  # So this would make Blog blog = new Blog() with empty parameters, where the create action will fill in the parameters (title and body)

    # Unlike the new action, create takes the formal parameters we typed in "title" and "body".
    # This is why when clicking "New" it leads us to the "New Blog" page without actually creating a new blog, rather a new instance.
    # Once we fill the parameters and hit "Create", the create method will be called which will take the parameters we entered
    # using (blog_params) and will perform validation logic (respond_to).
